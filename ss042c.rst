SpreadServe 0.4.2c notes
========================

**Install notes**

* Log in to spreadserve.com first: when you start SpreadServe on a new server for the first time, SpreadServeEngine
  will handshake with spreadserve.com and specify its owner using ``sseng.ini:OWNER`` and its hostname using
  ``%SSROOT%\cfg\dns_host_name.txt`` if present. You will only be able to set permissions for your new install
  via spreadserve.com's Permissions page if you've logged in to spreadserve.com previously with an email address
  matching the one in ``sseng.ini:OWNER``.
* Port 80 or 8090: RealTimeWebServer defaults to 8090. If you stay with this default you should fix ``%SSROOT%\cfg\dns_host_name.txt``
  to be ``myhostname:8090``. If you want to run on port 80 make sure no other process like IIS is on 80, that you're running
  with high enough rights to bind to port 80, and that you fix ``%SSROOT%\cfg\webcfg.py:RTWSPort=80``.
  
**Offline license key**

Firewall rules may prevent your SpreadServe install phoning home on port 80 to spreadserve.com. Or you may want to
avoid sharing any information about commercially sensitive spreadsheets. In those cases you'll need an offline license
key, which is free during the SpreadServe beta. The key below is good for any host until 2017-07-31. Paste it into
``%SSROOT%\cfg\license.txt``::
